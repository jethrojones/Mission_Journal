I talked a lot and felt the Spirit guiding me somewhat in the words I should say. We decided to fast for him today, Thanksgiving day [what was I thinking?]. We fasted as a district. We asked him to pray to know if he should stay here. He still says that he shouldn’t. So, he is meeting with President Edman, the MTC Mission President Friday morning sometime. I don’t think he will stay. President Mendenhall, our branch President told me that Elder Parscal had been a toss up since day one. He said that he wanted to transfer Elder Parscal to an English speaking mission. I hope he does that as opposed to having him go home. Thanksgiving was an awesome day, even though I didn’t get to eat the Thanksgiving feast; it was still wonderful. We had programs, three of them that lasted two hours each. There was a lot of singing and talents being shown. The Spirit was strong. At the end, we watched a movie called “Christmas Mission. ” It was an actual movie, and at the beginning there were previews. The previews started out okay, and the person in charge started to fast-forward it, and then there was a picture of two people getting ready to have sex. They quickly stopped the tape, and it was really funny. A guy played a song on the piano called “La Conovelse[?]. It was so fast. He was like a lightning bullet with his fingers. "

He told us about the “Hill of Howardess. ”![[Hill of howardess. jpg]]As missionaries, we are higher up in understanding than other people on the hill. He said that we need to descend to their level and find out where they are. Through questioning, we can make it to their level and help pull them to our level. It was really cool because we did some role-playing and one of us as the missionary and Brother Howard was the investigator. He acted like one and forced us to ask a whole bunch of questions. We really learned a lot. He is a great teacher. He jokes around a lot, but he is wonderful. Elder Parscal asked me to give him a blessing of comfort this morning. The Lord blessed him that he would have a determination to serve the Lord. It was a great experience. I love the Lord so much and I am so thankful to be here. I love the Gospel. "

    "body": "2000/11/21 - Today was great. I am almost late for bed, but I would like to write in length about today tomorrow when I get up. I need to cover how Russian is coming, how classes were today, how I need to devote all my energy to the Lord. I need to talk about an apostle of the Lord speaking to us. I need to talk about the testimony meeting following, and about Elder Parscal. Okay, I must write fast and furious because we never have enough time. Russian is coming along well, I think. I really enjoy it. I am glad that I am doing so well. I know that the Lord is blessing me. I can say a medium-length prayer. My testimony is lacking, but I have 3 sentences in the first discussion, fifth principle down. I love the Lord. Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles came and talked to all the missionaries at the MTC. As soon as he walked in the room, I could feel the Spirit of the Lord. I could tell that he was a man of God as soon as he started speaking. I could feel his power course through my body. What an amazing feeling! He spoke about many things, but the things that caught me the most are what I will write. He said that there is nothing more important in the field than each individual missionary and his testimony. “If one of us is lacking, we are all lacking. ”He said to be successful, we must be obedient, and busy. He said that we must soon become full-time missionaries. There are different reasons for us to serve; starting with the least important reason, he said:*Personal advantage*Good companionship*Fear*Duty*Hope of eternal reward*And most importantly, for the Love of ChristHe gave Moroni 7:48 as the reference that we can use to pray for the love of Christ. [Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen. ]He also told the importance of baptizing families and not just teenagers. It is important to establish the church. And we must be clean. We must always teach by the spirit. We must obey ALL the rules. We must report our companions if they are not doing so. To make promises to not report is following the admonition of the Gadianton robbers. We must work and gain trust of the members, so they will help us. We must set an example, we must love and act like proud missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. At our district meeting following, we all had wonderful comments about Elder Oaks’ talk. We all felt the spirit and had a testimony meeting following. Elder Parscal, who has really been having a horrible time, learned that he did have the spirit, and a desire to serve. He bore his testimony and we all could feel it powerfully. Elder Yoder told us why he came on a mission. He used to have a friend that he was really close to, but with whom he had never shared the gospel. He told us that he is afraid for when he crosses the veil and she says to him, “You had this wonderful plan of happiness and you never told me?” He doesn’t want to be held accountable for that. That would be horrible to lose a friend that you never shared the gospel with. "

I was very frustrated with my inability to learn Russian [understandably so, after 16 hours of trying to figure it out, I should have it mastered]. I was complaining and bothering the spirit for my roommates. Then, later, I was still frustrated, but at least I was not complaining. I just had a sour look on my face. Then one of my companions told us that he didn’t feel like he should be here. We told him it was Satan being a jerk and being evil. I bore my testimony and we prayed. We asked Heavenly Father for his Spirit to be with us. We went to class and towards the end, we had to teach the first discussion, and as I was teaching, I could feel the spirit. Then, when Elder Parscal started to teach, I could really feel the Spirit. He taught with such power. It was awesome. When we got back, we told him that we felt the Spirit when he was teaching. It was great. He still had doubts, but by the Spirit of our wonderful Heavenly Father, we were able to help Elder Parscal feel the Spirit and know that Heavenly Father loves him. God is wonderful. I love Him so much. When I bore my testimony before, it was through Heavenly Father’s grace and power. I pray that I may always recognize His hand in all things. I love Him so much. I know that His hand is always there and if I keep His commandments, I will live with Him again. I received my first letter today. It was from Amy, my sister. She just wrote to tell me that she loves me and is very proud of me. I love her very much and I am so happy that she is my sister. I love this church and I love this gospel. It is late, and I must retire. (We learned how to write in Russian tonight and it was cool). [Amy would become the best letter write in the family. It was always so cool to get a letter from her.

It is only your first day ever seeing it!]. I know that if I am humble and prayerful and hardworking, the Lord will bless me and loose my tongue. I do not have a companion yet, and I fell very alone.

I have two things that I want to make sure I get out tonight. On the way here, I realized that the adversary does not want me here. When we left my grandmother’s house, it was snowing heavily, and that was a little scary [boy, was I in a for a surprise when I got to Russia!]. Then, as we were driving, we asked my dad [via walkie-talkies] if he wanted to lead the way, and he said no, he would feel more comfortable if my mom and I led the way. We were driving and we somehow got a flat tire we had to stop to change in the snow. Then we got to Provo, stopped at Shopko, and Amy’s car battery died. It was sad. The other thing was that in my patriarchal blessing it says that I would be blessed if I went on a mission. One blessing is that my fear would be in control. All day, I have not been nervous. I have tried to be humble and prayerful, and my prayers have been answered. A wonderful feeling of calm and comfort was with me while my family was balling their eyes out. I love the Lord so much and without Him, I would be nothing. [I need to clarify a few things here. When I was a kid, I got scared anytime I was away from home. It is so bizarre to me now, but that is how it was. Before camping trips I would be a wreck, sick to my stomach and unable to do anything but worry. The first day of school was always absolutely horrible. Even my first year of college, I didn’t think that I could make it through those first couple days. Any time there was a big change, I became so nervous that I was incapable of doing anything. I have so many vivid memories of being sick to my stomach with worry. That is why this was so amazing. The day I was making the biggest change in my life and doing something so drastic was completely free of worry, fear, and nervousness. That blessing that I received could not be more true. It is possible that I had all those bad experiences to fulfill this promise. From that day on, I have never felt nervous about a big change in my life. I am sure I mention that later, but I want to be sure and record it now. ]  "

Yesterday, I had the wonderful opportunity to baptize my cousin [[Alessandra]]. It took me about five tries to get it right. That is OK. It was wonderful to have that opportunity. Today, we confirmed her and her brother ([[Christopher]], who was also baptized yesterday). It was a wonderful experience. I hope to always remember it. I am so happy for them. After we confirmed them, we sang “I Stand All Amazed” for the sacrament hymn. I had a few friends from work come and it was great for them to come…I would like to list those that came for me: All of my family, [[Andrea]], [[Jason]], their three kids, [[Amy]], [[Rebekah]], [[Matt]], [[George]], [[Amy]], [[Gideon]], [[Nathan]], and [[Kathy Kirstein]], my good friend from Spokane. I really love her a lot. She is my best friend. We have never dated, but I sure do love her; she is such a great example of faith and love and beauty. I am so glad she was able to make it. I am so glad everyone was able to make it. I was also set apart tonight and I feel that I should write about it. I don’t remember all of it, because [[President Smith]] was speaking so fast. But the two things that I remember most are very important. First, he said that I will be a mighty missionary, but MUST stay humble. I hope that I will be able to do that. He also told me that there are going to be many challenges that I have to face, and overcome. He told me later that these are mainly emotional problems, i. e. , lazy comps, rejection, etc. It was a wonderful blessing. I am so thankful for this opportunity to serve a mission and preach the gospel. [[Matt]], Rebekah’s husband, told me the best place I can be on my mission is on my knees. I firmly believe that. I pray that I may have the ability to remain humble throughout my mission. President Smith also told me that I need to write in this every night. I am going going to do that and I pray that I will remember to do it every night from now until I return home. I just want to bear my testimony that I know this church is true. I look forward to teaching the people of Novosibirsk, Russia the simple and easy parts of the Gospel like prayer. I am so thankful that I am worthy and able to serve the Lord. "
