I really love it here. Yesterday, Elder Allred from Virginia was called, or appointed to be our District Leader. He is a ver good person. I am glad that he is our D.L. I knew before he was called that he was going to be our D.L. I could just tell. I really like him. I think he is going to be very good. I see him as a friend that I may be able to keep for life. I would really like that. I told him I was positive it was going to be him. He said that he thought it would be me. I thought it was really cool that he said that. I really respect him.


I got a letter from my father today. It was very cool. He said he was going to try and take Russian at a community college. He is a good man. I love him. I pray in Russian now; it is really cool.
