It is a happy day because we dove into the language. It is also a sad day because Elder Williams, my companion, was called home. he had issues that he needed to deal with. he can't come back for four months. That is really sad. I really loved him [what?]. He had a great testimony. I am sad to see him go, but I pray that he will make it back.


Russian is very hard! I am still having a bit of difficulty with the alphabet [duh! It is only your first day ever seeing it!]. I know that if I am humble and prayerful and hardworking, the Lord will bless me and loose my tongue.


I do not have a companion yet, and I fell very alone. I miss Elder Williams. The two other elders in my room are Elder Parscal (the R is silent) and Elder Reich. They are cool. I love them, too. I miss my family :(, but I am not homesick. I miss Kathy greatly :(. If I remember, I will write my impressions of the MTC tomorrow.
