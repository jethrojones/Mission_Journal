Well, it starts. Today was my missionary farewell at church. It was a wonderful meeting. It started with Tony Panagos, a Greek man from work, playing "
[A Poor Wayfaring Man of Grief](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/a-poor-wayfaring-man-of-grief?lang=eng)" on the violin. Then we sang, "[Nearer My God, to Thee](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/nearer-my-god-to-thee?lang=eng)." [[George]] said the opening prayer.


Yesterday, I had the wonderful opportunity to baptize my cousin [[Alessandra]]. It took me about five tries to get it right. That is OK. It was wonderful to have that opportunity. Today, we confirmed her and her brother ([[Christopher]], who was also baptized yesterday). It was a wonderful experience. I hope to always remember it. I am so happy for them. After we confirmed them, we sang "[I Stand All Amazed](https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/media/music/songs/i-stand-all-amazed)" for the sacrament hymn.


I had a few friends from work come and it was great for them to come...I would like to list those that came for me: All of my family, [[Andrea]], [[Jason]], their three kids, [[Amy]], [[Rebekah]], [[Matt]], [[George]], [[Amy]], [[Gideon]], [[Nathan]], and [[Kathy Kirstein]], my good friend from Spokane. I really love her a lot. She is my best friend. We have never dated, but I sure do love her; she is such a great example of faith and love and beauty. I am so glad she was able to make it. I am so glad everyone was able to make it.


I was also set apart tonight and I feel that I should write about it. I don't remember all of it, because [[President Smith]] was speaking so fast. But the two things that I remember most are very important.


First, he said that I will be a mighty missionary, but MUST stay humble. I hope that I will be able to do that. He also told me that there are going to be many challenges that I have to face, and overcome. He told me later that these are mainly emotional problems, i.e., lazy comps, rejection, etc. It was a wonderful blessing. I am so thankful for this opportunity to serve a mission and preach the gospel.


[[Matt]], Rebekah's husband, told me the best place I can be on my mission is on my knees. I firmly believe that. I pray that I may have the ability to remain humble throughout my mission.


President Smith also told me that I need to write in this every night. I am going going to do that and I pray that I will remember to do it every night from now until I return home.


I just want to bear my testimony that I know this church is true. I look forward to teaching the people of Novosibirsk, Russia the simple and easy parts of the Gospel like prayer. I am so thankful that I am worthy and able to serve the Lord.
