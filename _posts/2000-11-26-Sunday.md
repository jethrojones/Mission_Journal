# Sun Nov 26, 2000

Well, today was an okay day. I have been really lazy all weekend, and I am very upset about it. I wish I were more diligent. I really love Russian, but I fall so easily into the trap of laziness. I am very frustrated by that.

I am also having a bit of a hard time. Amy sent me a picture of Kathy and me in front of the church the day of my farewell. I really love Kathy and miss her a lot. I hope she is doing well. I hope she is continuing to be a worthy temple recommend holder. I really love her a lot. She is really the only real friend I have. Argh, how frustrating.

Today we had a fireside, and the guy I was sitting next to stretched out his legs and hit the girl in front of him. She turned and asked if he was trying to play footsies. She seemed very serious. She told him he had better stop! I couldn’t believe it.

I laughed so hard. She turned around and asked if I had a problem, which made me laugh even harder. It was great. That was some good ol’ fashioned comedy.

Well, I am going to study my Russian discussions now. Goodnight!
