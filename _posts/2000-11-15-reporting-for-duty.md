I don't have much time to write so I will go fast. I reported today. My companion is Elder Travis Williams. He is from American Fork, UT.


I have two things that I want to make sure I get out tonight. On the way here, I realized that the adversary does not want me here. When we left my grandmother's house, it was snowing heavily, and that was a little scary [boy, was I in a for a surprise when I got to Russia!]. Then, as we were driving, we asked my dad [via walkie-talkies] if he wanted to lead the way, and he said no, he would feel more comfortable if my mom and I led the way. We were driving and we somehow got a flat tire we had to stop to change in the snow. Then we got to Provo, stopped at Shopko, and Amy's car battery died. It was sad.


The other thing was that in my patriarchal blessing it says that I would be blessed if I went on a mission. One blessing is that my fear would be in control. All day, I have not been nervous. I have tried to be humble and prayerful, and my prayers have been answered. A wonderful feeling of calm and comfort was with me while my family was balling their eyes out. I love the Lord so much and without Him, I would be nothing.
[I need to clarify a few things here. When I was a kid, I got scared anytime I was away from home. It is so bizarre to me now, but that is how it was. Before camping trips I would be a wreck, sick to my stomach and unable to do anything but worry. The first day of school was always absolutely horrible. Even my first year of college, I didn't think that I could make it through those first couple days. Any time there was a big change, I became so nervous that I was incapable of doing anything. I have so many vivid memories of being sick to my stomach with worry. That is why this was so amazing. The day I was making the biggest change in my life and doing something so drastic was completely free of worry, fear, and nervousness. That blessing that I received could not be more true. It is possible that I had all those bad experiences to fulfill this promise. From that day on, I have never felt nervous about a big change in my life. I am sure I mention that later, but I want to be sure and record it now.][![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcfwcAmRZsw7ymsa-yPFrO3ls6SWyiOzNFkDzurudERn12kJxvA0DUmZMf-h7T8T4hLZUooNv1i96gGbPsma6Dw8Un3Eg7xLen0lxEcxFLbntpCXIoyQqRejntA9ezSmhYH7h5VUqLu2NX/s400/003+MTC+Day+1+.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcfwcAmRZsw7ymsa-yPFrO3ls6SWyiOzNFkDzurudERn12kJxvA0DUmZMf-h7T8T4hLZUooNv1i96gGbPsma6Dw8Un3Eg7xLen0lxEcxFLbntpCXIoyQqRejntA9ezSmhYH7h5VUqLu2NX/s1600-h/003+MTC+Day+1+.jpg)
