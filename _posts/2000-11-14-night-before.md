Well, I just have 12.5 hours before my mission officially starts. I am very excited. We had a little family gathering here at my grandparent's tonight. It was great fun. My aunts and uncles and cousins came over.


Earlier today, I did an endowment session for a Mr. Benjamin Lancaster. The Salt Lake Temple is so beautiful.


There is more in my journal on this day.
