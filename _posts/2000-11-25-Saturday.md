# Sat Nov 25, 2000

Well today was preparation day. I did laundry, went to class, didnâ€™t do much studying. I wrote seven letters though. I also got a letter from Amy, with pictures of me & her, Matt, the boys, me and Rebekah (from whom I also received a letter) and a picture of Kathy and I. 

I really do love her a lot. My heart does a bit of a flutter when I see her picture or think about her. She is such a wonderful friend, I am so grateful to have her in my life.

I just wish she would write me a letter!! I wish there was more to say.

Goodnight.

Moroni 8:13 is my scripture for this day!

Today I got my patriarchal blessing shrunk to a size that will fit in my scriptures. As we picked it up from the copy center, I looked at one really fast and then told the girl that they missed a spot! It was really funny.
