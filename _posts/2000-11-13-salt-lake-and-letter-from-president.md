Well, today is my second day of being an Elder. I am so happy that I am here doing what I am doing. I know that as much as I put my faith in the Lord, he will bless me. We drove up here (to Salt Lake City) to the house I used to live in when I was a little child! It is really cool to be here again and have so many memories come flooding back.


Today I talked with my parents about things of a spiritual nature. I say it like that because we covered just about everything. It was great. tomorrow, I am going to go do an endowment session in the Salt Lake Temple. I am really excited to go! I am so grateful for this wonderful opportunity. I feel so blessed that I am able to do this. My stake president wrote me a note yesterday, and right now is my first chance to read it. When he gave it to me, he told me that he felt inspired to write it. This is what it says:

> Dear Jethro (Elder Jones)
	What a blessing it was for us to hear your strong testimony! The Lord needs valiant spirits like you in Russia. The spirit teaches me what a wonderful, powerful influence for good (among a very special segment of Heavenly Father's children), you will be in that far-away land. Thank you for honoring the priesthood you bear.

> Your Gospel Brother-

> [[President Marlon Smith]]

> P.S. Return with Honor

I don't think I need to say anything about that. It is awesome.
