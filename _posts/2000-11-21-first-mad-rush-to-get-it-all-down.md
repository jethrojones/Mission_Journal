Today was great. I am almost late for bed, but I would like to write in length about today tomorrow when I get up. I need to cover how Russian is coming, how classes were today, how I need to devote all my energy to the Lord. I need to talk about an apostle of the Lord speaking to us. I need to talk about the testimony meeting following, and about Elder Parscal.Okay, I must write fast and furious because we never have enough time. Russian is coming along well, I think. I really enjoy it. I am glad that I am doing so well. I know that the Lord is blessing me. I can say a medium-length prayer. My testimony is lacking, but I have 3 sentences in the first discussion, fifth principle down. I love the Lord.Elder Dallin H. Oaks of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles came and talked to all the missionaries at the MTC. As soon as he walked in the room, I could feel the Spirit of the Lord. I could tell that he was a man of God as soon as he started speaking. I could feel his power course through my body. What an amazing feeling! He spoke about many things, but the things that caught me the most are what I will write.He said that there is nothing more important in the field than each individual missionary and his testimony. "If one of us is lacking, we are all lacking."He said to be successful, we must be obedient, and busy. He said that we must soon become full-time missionaries. There are different reasons for us to serve; starting with the least important reason, he said:*Personal advantage
*Good companionship
*Fear
*Duty
*Hope of eternal reward
*And most importantly, for the Love of ChristHe gave 
[Moroni 7:48](http://scriptures.lds.org/en/moro/7/48) as the reference that we can use to pray for the love of Christ. [Wherefore, my beloved brethren, pray unto the Father with all the energy of heart, that ye may be filled with this love, which he hath bestowed upon all who are true followers of his Son, Jesus Christ; that ye may become the sons of God; that when he shall appear we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is; that we may have this hope; that we may be purified even as he is pure. Amen.]He also told the importance of baptizing families and not just teenagers. It is important to establish the church. And we must be clean. We must always teach by the spirit. We must obey ALL the rules. We must report our companions if they are not doing so. To make promises to not report is following the admonition of the 
[Gadianton robbers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gadianton_robbers).We must work and gain trust of the members, so they will help us. We must set an example, we must love and act like proud missionaries of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.At our district meeting following, we all had wonderful comments about Elder Oaks' talk. We all felt the spirit and had a testimony meeting following. Elder Parscal, who has really been having a horrible time, learned that he did have the spirit, and a desire to serve. He bore his testimony and we all could feel it powerfully. Elder Yoder told us why he came on a mission. He used to have a friend that he was really close to, but with whom he had never shared the gospel. He told us that he is afraid for when he crosses the veil and she says to him, "You had this wonderful plan of happiness and you never told me?" He doesn't want to be held accountable for that. That would be horrible to lose a friend that you never shared the gospel with.
