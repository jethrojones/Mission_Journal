Wow, what a day today. Elder Parscal went and talked with the mission president, called his mom, and decided to get transferred to an English mission. We don't know where he is going, but it will probably be stateside. Class was good today. In between A class and Dinner, I memorized another line on discussion #1. I wish that my family would write me some letters. I also wish Kathy would, too. 

I know that I should be devoting all my time to the Lord, but I feel that not hearing from anyone in my what seems like a long time is starting to get to me. 

I don't want to call it homesickness, because I don't think that is what it is. I guessI am just feeling a lack of love. I have already lost two companions, that is kind of rough. I like Elder Reich, my companion, but he is rather cocky and headstrong. That is difficult. I want to love him, and even though he says arrogant things a lot, I try and make him feel like I am not abandoning him. I know that I am trying really hard to like him. It is not easy, but I feel that it is very important. 

I did a lot of studying today and it felt really good to spend my time wisely. 

I know that the the Lord loves me and He has blessed me greatly. I love the Lord so much. He has helped me be happy during this this trying time. He has helped me to be strong and has blessed me with the ability to "bounce back."

Working with and helping Elder Parscal has really drained me physically and mentally. The Lord has buoyed me up in spirit and has blessed me greatly. He has rejuvenated me and helped me so much. I just love it here at the MTC. I am so grateful for all that I have: my family, my friends, my district, my branch, my companions. 

I love it here. The Lord is wonderful and great. I love him so much. I am late for bed. 

Goodnight.
