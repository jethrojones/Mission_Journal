Tomorrow is Thanksgiving. We are going to have some time to write letters of thanks to friends and family. I think that I will write to Andrea and Jason.Well, today was really awesome. We had Brother Howard teach to us twice, and he is only our morning teacher. He told us about the "Hill of Howardess."

As missionaries, we are higher up in understanding than other people on the hill. He said that we need to descend to their level and find out where they are. Through questioning, we can make it to their level and help pull them to our level. It was really cool because we did some role-playing and one of us as the missionary and Brother Howard was the investigator. He acted like one and forced us to ask a whole bunch of questions. We really learned a lot. He is a great teacher. He jokes around a lot, but he is wonderful.[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcj5ag2bMG4UDWd9wVuUtkb4ZhBsASC5c60fu-nhKZXL3T49qFKmPGrvb4NU6CmsmAnfZavosbhSguPHl9SUlULjNb565TiDv4euX5ZfvI_yEUBV90wVc1af1n5tJ8MCTUkG03Mj3wW0I7/s400/Christmas+in+MTC+000.jpg)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcj5ag2bMG4UDWd9wVuUtkb4ZhBsASC5c60fu-nhKZXL3T49qFKmPGrvb4NU6CmsmAnfZavosbhSguPHl9SUlULjNb565TiDv4euX5ZfvI_yEUBV90wVc1af1n5tJ8MCTUkG03Mj3wW0I7/s1600-h/Christmas+in+MTC+000.jpg)Elder Parscal asked me to give him a blessing of comfort this morning. The Lord blessed him that he would have a determination to serve the Lord. It was a great experience. I love the Lord so much and I am so thankful to be here. I love the Gospel.
