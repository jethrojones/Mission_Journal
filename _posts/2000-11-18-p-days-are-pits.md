Well, today was a good day. I feel that I am getting a better grasp each day. It was preparation day today, which means that we have four hours to clean and be ready for the next week. It was good, because while was waiting for my laundry to be completed, I wrote letters: one to George and Amy, one to Kathy, one to Becky Simmons, one to Ty and Tish Curry. It was good, but made me a little homesick. We have our first Sunday tomorrow. I am pretty excited. I really love church. I am so thankful to God for blessing me as he has. I said a prayer tonight in Russian; it was my first time and it was cool. I love Russian.


[As you will undoubtedly notice, the ends of some of my entries will be very strange. My goal was to write one page every day, and some days, that was incredibly difficult. I may just start deleting that stuff.
