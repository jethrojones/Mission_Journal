Today was once again, awesome. Church was really good. Our Branch President, President Mendenhall, is really cool. He has a lot of love and gusto for the church. We had a fireside tonight for the whole MTC. The speakers were the President of the MTC and his wife. We sang six songs and they told missionary stories. It was so great. I love singing praises to our God and King. He is great. 


Then we went to another fireside about temples. That was awesome. We were counseled by President Nixon to wear our garments properly. That was the gist of it. We sang "High on the Mountaintop." That is a great song. I prayed with my district tonight in Russian again. It was really cool. I love it here.
